<Info>
    **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or higher).
</Info>

Step 1. 코드 보관소 생성(S3 Bucket 사용)
Step 2. 인스턴스 생성(EC2)
Step 3. 배포 관리자 생성(CodeDeploy)
Step 4. 권한 생성(IAM)
    - 역할 생성
        A. 배포 역할
| EC2 Role                |
|-------------------------|
| AWSCodeDeployFullAccess |
| AmazonS3FullAccess      |

        B. 빌드 역할
| CodeDeploy Role   |
|-------------------|
| AWSCodeDeployRole |

    - 계정 생성
        A. 배포 계정
| Github Actions Build IAM User |
|-------------------------------|
| AWSCodeDeployFullAccess       |
| AmazonS3FullAccess            |
        B. 액세스 키 생성
Github Actions 액세스 키 설정

Step 5.

<CodeGroup>

```bash AmazonLinux
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install ruby
    sudo yum install wget
    cd /home/ec2-user
    # wget https://:bucket-name.s3.:region-identifier.amazonaws.com/latest/install
    wget https://aws-codedeploy-ap-northeast-2.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/latest/install
    chmod +x ./install
    sudo ./install auto
```

</CodeGroup>
[리전별 리소스 키트 버킷 명](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/codedeploy/latest/userguide/resource-kit.html#resource-kit-bucket-names)

<CodeGroup>

```bash AmazonLinux
    systemctl status codedeploy-agent
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
folder. Then Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone
https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

Repeat step 3.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting an unknown error">
    Try navigating to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder.
    Then run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
